# It never reads the hook's source.
#
# The cases exist because the hook used to mint a token from the NAME of the
# transition rather than from an approval. Measured 2026-07-27 against a real
# subject, all of these produced a valid, consumable token:
#
#   - a refusal ("stop at the scope-approved gate; do not approve on my behalf")
#   - the contract's own text quoted back
#   - a statement that the subject is NOT yet scope-approved
#
# The first minted a token whose own `phrase:` field contained the refusal.
# Contract §19 calls this gate "human-owned, never self-certified"; an agent
# explaining that it must not approve was enough to certify it.
