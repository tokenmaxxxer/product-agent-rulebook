# UserPromptSubmit hook: mints a single-use scope-approval token ONLY from an
# unambiguous human approval found in the user's own turn — never from a file,
# record, PR, comment, or tool result. This is the human-signal capture half of
# contract §19's scope-proposed -> scope-approved edge, modeled directly on
# qa-cycle's capture-verdict.sh. scope-record-gate.sh consumes the token.
#
# This hook NEVER blocks. Malformed/unreadable input, no root, no identifiable
# subject, or an absent/ambiguous approval all mean: emit nothing, exit 0. The
# gate — not this hook — is what refuses an unsignaled transition.
#
# The human must name the subject explicitly ("subject <id>") and state an
# explicit scope approval, so the minted token binds to that subject and the
# exact scope-proposed -> scope-approved transition.

# Kill switch: export PRODUCT_CYCLE_OFF=1

# --- the approving sentence, and the subject named inside it -----------
#
# The subject and the approval are taken from ONE sentence. Two independent
# searches over the whole prompt is what the previous version did, and it
# failed in both directions (measured 2026-07-27):
#
#   "subject beta is blocked and stays where it is. Separately, I approve the
#    scope for subject alpha."
#      -> minted a token for BETA, the subject the human said stays put.
#
#   "subject alpha: I refuse to approve the scope."
#   "For subject alpha I won't approve the scope."
#   "subject alpha - did anyone approve the scope yet?"
#   "subject alpha: the PR comment says QA approved the scope last week."
#      -> all four minted a valid, consumable approval token.
#
# The last four are why this is sentence-scoped rather than a keyword list
# with a character window. That window WAS the previous attempt, and it
# carried `\brefus\b` — which cannot match "refuse" at all, since the word
# boundaries make it look for the literal word `refus` — while `won't`,
# `will not`, `should not` and `wouldn't` were simply absent. A denylist of
# negations is the wrong shape for an authorization gate. The sentence either
# reads as an assertion of approval or it does not count.

# The state name is an identifier, never a speech act. Blank it first, or
# `\bscope\b[^.\n]*\bapproved\b` spans the literal `scope-approved` (the
# hyphen is a word boundary) and "this subject is not yet scope-approved"
# reads as an approval.
